Here is the small Power BI project I created with the help of my MSSQL database. 
It includes a report on the Driver Safety Scorecard, featuring data from September 1, 2024. 
In this project, I developed the dashboard using KPIs, a donut chart, and a bar graph, along with DAX queries to enhance interactivity.
